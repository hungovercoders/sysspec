# Contributing

This applies to humans and coding agents equally: the checks are the
contract, and they are identical locally, in the git hooks, and in CI.

This repo is both the `sysspec` toolkit and its living example
(orders/payments). Contributions here change the product; adopters running
their own spec suites never edit this repo — they pin the CLI, the reusable
workflows and the plugin, per the README's "Start your own spec suite".

## Setup

```sh
task setup   # installs the pinned toolchain (mise) and the git hooks
```

Everything runs through [Task](https://taskfile.dev). If a command is not a
`task`, it is not part of the workflow.

## The one command that matters

```sh
task ci
```

Exactly what CI runs. It composes, in order:

| Task | What it enforces |
| --- | --- |
| `check:branch` | branch is `main`, `<user>/gri-<number>-<slug>` (Linear convention), or `claude/<slug>` (agent sessions) |
| `lint:specs` | Spectral over the OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contracts, house naming rules included |
| `lint:features` | gherkin-lint over the acceptance criteria |
| `lint:datacontracts` | datacontract-cli over the ODCS data contracts, plus Spectral for naming |
| `lint:manifest` | manifests ⇄ contracts ⇄ spec graph consistency, semver versions, feature references resolve to real messages and channels |
| `check:version` | any gated artifact change bumps its manifest version *and* the service's top-level version; artifact major ⇒ service major |
| `check:plugin` | plugin surface changes (cli, mcp, skills, plugin manifests) bump the plugin version |
| `check:cli` | changes under `cli/` bump the `sysspec` package version (`check:mcp` likewise for `mcp/`) |
| `docs:build` | the generated docs site builds `--strict` |
| `docs:diagrams` | every mermaid diagram in the generated site parses (mermaid-cli, headless Chromium) |
| `check:commits` | conventional commit messages |
| `check:compat` | breaking contract changes carry major bumps (artifact and service) |
| `check:intent` | every added schema element is named in the service's feature files — no escape hatch |
| `mocks:*` | Microcks mocks load, contract-test, and smoke-test green |

Scope most tasks to one service with `SERVICE=<name>`.

## Changing the specs

Gated artifacts — AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, ODCS data contracts, feature files —
are the spec of record — the system intent. Never edit one to make an implementation or a
test pass; that direction is always a finding, not a fix. When you do change
one deliberately:

1. Bump the artifact's version in `specs/<service>/service.yaml` (and
   `info.version` in the spec — they must match).
2. Bump the service's top-level `version:`. Breaking change ⇒ major on both.
3. If you added a schema element, name it in a scenario in that service's
   `features/` — `check:intent` fails otherwise, deliberately without an
   escape hatch.
4. Conventions (channel naming, payload rules, money, idempotency) live in
   `skills/sysspec/SKILL.md`. Attribute names and enumerated values
   are `lower_snake_case` everywhere — `.spectral.yaml` holds the rules for
   the specs, and `lint:datacontracts` applies the equivalent ruleset to the
   ODCS files (datacontract-cli has no hook for house rules, so Spectral
   does that half). A spec suite that wants a different rule for its data
   contracts overrides the bundled ruleset with its own
   `.spectral-datacontracts.yaml` at the repo root.

On merge to main, each changed service is published as a lightweight git tag
`<service>/v<version>`. Implementation and consumer repos pin those tags
via a `contracts.lock` and pull updates through Renovate — see
`skills/implement-service/SKILL.md` and `skills/consume-service/SKILL.md`.
The specs never push work at them.

## Pull requests

One Linear ticket per PR, branch named from the ticket, conventional
commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, …— the hooks enforce this). Open PRs as
drafts; keep `task ci` green.

Agent sessions that arrive with a pre-assigned `claude/<slug>` branch may
push it as-is (`check:branch` accepts the prefix); the preferred flow is
still to create the Linear ticket first and push to its generated
`gitBranchName`, linking the ticket from the PR body either way.

## The Claude Code plugin

This repo doubles as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`):
the MCP server (`mcp/`) plus the skills are the installed surface. If a
change alters that surface — server behaviour, any skill, the bundled
templates — bump the plugin `version` in the same PR (semver:
breaking/feature/fix). `task check:plugin` enforces this. The plugin runs
the committed server bundle (`mcp/dist/stdio.mjs`) directly, so a server
change also means rebuilding it (`npm run build` in `mcp/`) —
`task check:mcp:dist` fails when the bundle is stale; the CLI bundle
(`cli/dist/cli.mjs`, which the Taskfile itself runs) has the same rule via
`task check:cli:dist`. The skills are baked into the MCP bundle too
(served to any client via `list_skills`/`get_skill`), so editing a skill
also means rebuilding `mcp/dist` and bumping the mcp package version —
the same two gates enforce it.

## Releasing sysspec

The CLI (gates, mocks, docs, `init` scaffold) is published to npm as
`sysspec`. To cut a release: make sure `cli/package.json` carries the new
version (`check:cli` forces this whenever `cli/` changes), then tag the
merge commit `v<version>` and push the tag. `release.yml` verifies the tag
matches the package version, builds and tests, publishes via npm trusted
publishing (OIDC — provenance attached, no token stored), and force-moves
the floating `v<major>` tag that adopter workflows reference. Product `v*`
tags live alongside the `<service>/v*` contract tags.

One-time setup: publish the first version manually (`npm publish` from
`cli/`, so the package exists), then on npmjs.com add a *trusted
publisher* for `sysspec` pointing at this repository and workflow
`release.yml`.

## Releasing sysspec-mcp

The MCP server (`mcp/`) is published to npm as `sysspec-mcp`. To cut a
release: make sure `mcp/package.json` carries the new version
(`check:mcp` forces this whenever `mcp/` changes) and that
`SYSSPEC_MCP` in `cli/src/pins.ts` points at the version
scaffolded repos should pin, then tag the merge commit `mcp-v<version>`
and push the tag. `mcp-release.yml` verifies the tag matches the package
version, builds and tests, and publishes via npm trusted publishing
(OIDC — provenance attached, no token stored).

One-time setup: publish the first version manually (`npm publish` from
`mcp/`, so the package exists), then on npmjs.com add a *trusted
publisher* for `sysspec-mcp` pointing at this repository and workflow
`mcp-release.yml`.

The hosted-URL image needs no release: `mcp-image.yml` republishes
`ghcr.io/hungovercoders/sysspec-mcp` (server + this repo's specs) on
every push to main, and any container host serves it — see
[mcp/README.md](mcp/README.md).
