# System specs

The spec of record for this domain's services: AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, ODCS
data contracts and Gherkin acceptance criteria — system intent, versioned
and gated. Built on [sysspec](https://github.com/__SYSSPEC_REPO_SLUG__).

- `task ci` is the definition of green - the same gates run locally, in the
  pre-commit hook and in CI.
- Gated artifacts are never edited to make an implementation pass. Bump the
  artifact and service versions in `service.yaml` with every change; merges
  to main publish each changed service as a `<service>/v<version>` git tag
  that implementation and consumer repos pin.
- `task mocks:load` stands up Microcks mocks of every service so UIs and
  consumers can build before implementations exist.
- The machinery arrives by reference and stays current via Renovate: the
  `sysspec@` pin in `Taskfile.yml`, the `sysspec-mcp@` pin in
  `.mcp.json` (both npm), and the reusable workflows under `.github/workflows/`.
- Agents get the same specs over MCP (`.mcp.json`) and the deeper
  processes via the sysspec plugin's skills — install with
  `/plugin marketplace add __SYSSPEC_REPO_SLUG__` then `/plugin install`,
  and ask to implement or consume a service. The `implement-service` and
  `consume-service` skills carry the whole loop, from contract pin to
  verified definition of done, and read as walkthroughs in their own
  right.

The `greeter` service is scaffold output - replace it with your first real
service.
